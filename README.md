# Medical-Students-Data-Analysis---Exploring-Student-Health-Metrics

## Introduction

In this documentation, we will guide you through the process of analyzing medical student data to gain insights into health-related metrics. Specifically, we will create Pivot Tables to display average values for various health parameters for both male and female students, average height and weight for both genders, the number of students across different blood groups, the number of students who smoke and those who don't, and the number of students with and without diabetes. This analysis will help provide a comprehensive overview of the health statistics of medical students.

## Project Objectives and Goals

- Calculate and Visualize Health Metrics: Create Pivot Tables to display average values for health parameters (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol) for both male and female students.

- Visualize Height and Weight: Show the average height and weight for both male and female students in two decimal places.

- Analyze Blood Groups: Present the number of students across different blood groups.

- Study Smoking Habits: Display the number of students who smoke and those who don't.

- Examine Diabetes Prevalence: Show the number of students with diabetes and those without.

## Project Structure and Organization

The Medical Students Data Analysis project is structured for clarity and easy navigation. It consists of the following core functional modules:
